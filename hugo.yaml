          - Designed and developed a Global Performance Test Reporting Tool to standardize report generation and accelerate performance result analysis across teams—reducing manual reporting effort by 31 hours per test and generating estimated annual savings of $1.2 million.

          - The tool was implemented as a thin-client web application using ASP.NET (frontend) and Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (backend), accessible through a browser-based interface. Users could upload HTML reports (in ZIP format), from which the tool would automatically extract, parse, and insert performance data into a structured database.

          - Key achievements include:
            - Reduced reporting effort from 8000 to 2000 hours per year.
            - Automated report generation, enabling main reports in 30 seconds and detailed reports in under 2 minutes.
            - Created a scalable and standardized framework for trend analysis and test result archival, enabling real-time performance insights and improved decision-making.

          - The tool became an integral part of the testing lifecycle, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and data reliability for global performance engineering teams.
